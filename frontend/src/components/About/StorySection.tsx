          While working with logistics and trading companies in East Africa, we
          observed the challenges that arise from fragmented operationsâ€”manual
          HR processes, untracked inventory, financial discrepancies, and
          inefficient workflow. Marjaan Solutions was born from a desire to
          empower companies with a unified digital platform that simplifies
          operations, increases productivity, and supports growth.
